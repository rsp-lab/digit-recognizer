# Digit Recognizer

![Digit Recognizer Image](/digit-recognizer-image.png?raw=false)

This application recognizes digits from 0 to 9 based on voice input (written in wav files) using neural networks. I developed the application for educational purposes. Implemented in C#.

### Usage:
1. Run **Digit Recognizer.exe**
2. Select a directory with voice samples to train the network (e.g. _SampleImput_).
3. Choose a file with a voice sample. An example file can be found in _the SampleTest_ directory.
